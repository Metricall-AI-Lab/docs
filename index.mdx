## What is Uplint?

Uplint is the trust layer for incoming data. It sits between the outside world and your infrastructure, ensuring that every piece of data is understood, verified, and trusted before it enters your system.

Every cloud has storage, compute, and queues — but nothing that understands what's *inside* incoming files. S3 stores bytes. It doesn't know if those bytes form a blank PDF, a renamed executable, or a restaurant receipt uploaded as a medical claim.

Uplint fills that gap with a single API call.

## What Uplint does

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Structural Validation" icon="shield-check">
    Verifies the internal binary structure matches the declared format. Catches corrupt files, polyglot files, and format spoofing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Content Intelligence" icon="brain">
    Detects blank documents, empty spreadsheets, single-color images, and whitespace-only text files.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Threat Detection" icon="virus-slash">
    Scans every upload for malware signatures, embedded scripts, and exploit patterns using ClamAV.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Context-Aware Rules" icon="sliders">
    Define per-context pipelines with allowed extensions, size limits, rate limits, and storage quotas.
  </Card>

## How it works

```javascript
const result = await uplint.validate(file, {
  context: "patient-records",
  scan: true,
  detectBlanks: true,
});

if (!result.trusted) {
  // result.reasons: "blank_document" | "content_mismatch" | "threat_detected" | ...
}
```

One call triggers the full trust pipeline: structural validation, content analysis, blank detection, threat scanning, and audit logging.
